Before starting the topic let me introduce myself. I am a Mobile Developer currently working in Warsaw and spending my free time for interview preparations. I started to prepare for interviews two years ago. At that time I should say I could not solve the two sum problem. Easy problems seemed to me like hard ones so most of the time I had to look at editorials and discuss section. Currently, I have solved ~800 problems and time to time participate in contests. I usually solve 3 problems in a contest and sometimes 4 problems. Ok, lets come back to the topic.
 
Recently I have concentrated my attention on Dynamic Programming cause its one of the hardest topics in an interview prep. After solving ~140 problems in DP I have noticed that there are few patterns that can be found in different problems. So I did a research on that and find the following topics. I will not give complete ways how to solve problems but these patterns may be helpful in solving DP.

# Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target

Generate problem statement for this pattern
 
### Statement
> Given a target find minimum (maximum)  cost / path / sum to reach the target.
 
### Approach
 
> Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.
 
```cpp
routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ... , routes[i-k]) + cost[i]
```
 
Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target.
 
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] = min(dp[j], dp[i - ways[j]]) + cost / path / sum;
       }
   }
}
 
return dp[target]
```

# DP on Strings
---
 
General problem statement for this pattern can vary but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big
 
### Statement
> Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `some result`.
 
### Approach
 
> Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in O(n^2) complexity.
 
```cpp
// i - indexing string s1
// j - indexing string s2
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
       if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
```
 
> If you are given one string `s` the approach may little vary
 
```cpp
for (int l = 1; l < n; ++l) {
   for (int i = 0; i < n-l; ++i) {
       int j = i + l;
       if (s[i] == s[j]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {

# Decision Making
---
 
The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires you to make a decision at a current state.
 
### Statement
> Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore the current value.
 
### Approach
 
> If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.
 
```cpp
// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
   }
}
